# so what's this all about?

Chappie is a Telegram bot that leverages the OpenAI API to allow users to communicate with a large language model directly through the Telegram platform. The purpose of the project is to provide a convenient way for users to access and interact with the capabilities of the OpenAI language model without needing to visit the website or sign up for an account.
Some key features of the bot may include: 
- the ability to handle a wide range of natural language inputs and generate human-like responses, 
- as well as the ability to save and track conversations with the bot for future reference. 

Overall, the project aims to make it easy for users to access and use the advanced language processing capabilities of OpenAI's language model through a familiar and convenient messaging platform.

## Getting Started

You can simply find the bot at [@gpt3_tgBot](https://web.telegram.org/k/#@gpt3_tgBot "@gpt3_tgBot").

## Contributing
Are you interested in contributing to the project? We would love to review your pull requests. Here are a few areas we are currently focusing on:

- Adding context support to Chappie. Right now, Chappie doesn't remember the context from previous conversations.
- Disabling users from sending additional requests before receiving a response to their previous request.

Feel free to contribute any ideas or improvements that you believe will enhance Chappie's functionality. We look forward to reviewing your contributions.
